            <h4>
            Aquatic animals have been treated unfairly and used for  humans, to be <br>
            happy. People train these animals to show off what they’ve done to them, how <br>
            these people hurt these animals.  Aquatic animals  are taken away from their <br>
            homes in fishing nets and put into tanks, so we humans are satisfied and get<br>
             a show.<br>
            If people keep on buying and seeing these animals go through tourture, then <br>
            aquatic animals will continue to be used for our enjoyment. This will lead to<br>
             more and more animals being in pain to just live up to our expectations. This<br>
              has to be stopped. These animals risk their lives for our entertainment and <br>
              satisfaction. <br>
            People of today need to stop paying to see these animals in glass prison cells.<br>
             They are suffering from something they can’t control and we need to give these<br>
              the freedom they deserve. People just shouldn’t stand around and do nothing.<br>
               They need to help these animals become free.

            <h3>Intriguing Facts:</h3>
            <h4>
            1. Orcas’ Sunburns Are Covered Up With Black Zinc Oxide<br>
            <br>
            2. Collapsed Dorsal Fins Aren’t Healthy or Normal<br>
            <br>
            3. In 1978, SeaWorld captured two sharks from the ocean and put them in
            <br>
             an enclosure. Within three day, they’d run into a wall, sunk to the bottom 
             <br> 
             of the enclosure, and died.
