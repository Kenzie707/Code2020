            <h4>
            Land animals are one of the most mistreated zoo animals ever. Many zoos<br>
             neglect, don’t feed, and these zoos don’t give enough space for these <br>
             animals to roam around. This will cause animals to go into a deep sadness <br>
             linger on to them.
            <br>
            Land animals are just put into cages and are made out to be the best attractions.<br>
             If this was true, than why are zoos taking away the lives of these innocent <br>
             beings. Zoos give little space for animals, no toys to play with, and zoos are <br>
            depriving these animals of food. If zoos keep on doing this to they’re  animals,<br>
             we should be able to see how horror like zoos are to they’re animals.
            <br>
            People should how badly these zoos are treating these animals and making them <br>
            worse before they even got into the zoos. Zoos are using these animals for money <br>
            and making them closer to death than any should be.

                1.In 2007 that member zoos were being actively encouraged to kill unwanted animals, 
                including tigers, if other zoos did not want them and if they were hybrids. It said<br>
                 that such animals take up space and keeper time.
                <br><br>
                2. 40% of lion cubs die before one month of age in zoos. In the wild, only 30% of<br>
                 cubs are thought to die.
