            <h4>
            Animals from the wild are forced out of their habitats only to be put on display for<br>
             mankind to provide entertainment. We pay to see these animals suffer for our <br> 
             pleasure; while these animals are taken from their homes and they yearn for<br> 
             the lives they once lived. These animals are forced to put on a performance <br>
             for us and perform with no reward.<br>
            People continue to pay to see animals in grief, despair, and sorrow. We watch<br>
            them as they suffer from the cages they were made for, but there is a way to <br>
            stop them from suffering. Now is the time for change, Donate to Freedom for <br>
            Animals and save animals today.
